# KeyedVerificationAnonymousCredential-model

A Lean 4 formalization of the keyed-verification anonymous credential (KVAC) framework of [Orrù, *Revisiting Keyed-Verification Anonymous Credentials* (IACR ePrint 2024/1552)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1552), together with two concrete instantiations (μCMZ and μBBS).

The formalization plan is a tentative working proposal — see [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) for what is being built.

## Building

```bash
lake build
```

Requires the Lean 4 toolchain pinned in [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) (currently `v4.28.0-rc1`); install via [elan](https://github.com/leanprover/elan). The first build fetches [Mathlib](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4) and may take 10–20 minutes; subsequent builds use the cache.

## Documentation

The Verso blueprint at https://beneficial-ai-foundation.github.io/KeyedVerificationAnonymousCredential-model/ is the live, rendered view of the formalization, with per-chapter prose tied to the Lean declarations as they land. The markdown documents below cover the formalization plan, work breakdown, and contribution workflow.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Start by reading [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md), then pick a track from [`docs/TRACKS.md`](docs/TRACKS.md). Reach out via the [Signal Shot Zulip channel](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/583276-Signal-Shot) before starting work — especially on Track 0 (Core typeclasses) or Track Σ (sigma-protocol DSL), whose API shapes are reviewed centrally before any track that depends on them can begin.
